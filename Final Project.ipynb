    "This website helps to both explain spikes in COVID deaths in Japan, in addition to helping assess Japan's response to the pandemic in comparison to their peers. In the first half of the website, a link can be drawn between the months with high cases, and the months with high deaths. Every month with a case spike in Japan was followed by a death spike (April-May, August-September, November-December). This can help health authorities anticipate spikes in death and hospitalization in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second half, Japan's efforts are compared. Japan's case to population ratio is revealed to be lower than the US's, indicating a more successful response to limiting the spread of COVID-19 than America. Similarly, in the last section, Japan's average cases per month are typically lower than the rest of Asia, demonstrating their relative success in reducing COVID spread in 2020. This can help to identify effective public health strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "There are some limitations to this data. Conclusions can only be used in the context of 2020, which is where this data is from. Due to new variants of COVID emerging every day, conclusions regarding the links with high case and death rates (following each other in monthly spikes) may not apply. Similarly, the Japanese data was only compared to the US and Asia, and therefore can only be discussed in comparison to those two regions/countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements:\n",
    "To mitigate some of the limitations, it would be helpful to include more recent data and compare it to more countries/regions. This would provide a more updated and relevant understanding of the Japanese response to COVID-19, and would allow us to draw more conclusions due to the newer data and comparisons. In addition, developing a vizualization for the case to population ratios would make the data easier to understand."
